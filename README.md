# ERCOT DART Power Trading Project

This project is an implementation of a DART trading strategy on the ERCOT Market. In this repository you can find:

1. Codes folder: Many Notebook files where you can find the modelisation/data analysis of the different component of the DART trading strategy. You will also find the implementation of a Naive and a more sophisticated DART trading stragy with backetsting.
2. Data folder: Even though one can get the data through the ERCOT API, we saved them to avoid calling the API every time we want to test the strategy
3. Papers folder: List of books and papers that helped me to understand the US power market, the financial products, and the trading strategies
